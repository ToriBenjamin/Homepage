<h2> About me </h2>
<p> I am a 3rd-year student at UC Blue Ash in my 2nd year in Media Communication after changing my major a year into my education. My passion has always been art and I have been wanting to improve my skills. I feel that college has always been the best option for me and I'd love to take my creative mind into the work field. </p>

<p> My art outside of school tends to focus on pencil graphite portraits that have a splash of color in them somewhere. I also indulge in drawing some original characters of mine, as well as anime characters. While I can do art digitally and I understand that it's pretty much the new norm today, I very much prefer traditional art done on paper.  




<h2> My Cats </h2>
<p>I have two cats, a black one, <strong>Jovie</strong>, and an orange one, <strong>Sammy</strong>. Both cats have very different but adorable personalities.</p> 
  
  <h3> Jovie </h3> 
  <p>Jovie is more of "my" cat in the sense that I'm always the person in my family that she hangs around the most. She has a cat tree in my room and can usually be found either there or in my bed. She is almost 4 years old and very shy, but she's getting better about meeting new people.</p>
  
  <h3> Sammy </h3>
  <p>Sammy usually resides in our basement because, like a typical orange cat, he's a bit crazy. We still love him though. He is about 1 year old and decently social, though Jovie's timidness has rubbed off on him a bit. </p>
