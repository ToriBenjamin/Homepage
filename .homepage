  <h1> Tori Benjamin </h1>
    


<p> I am a 3rd-year student at UC Blue Ash in my 2nd year in Media Communication after changing my major a year into my education. My passion has always been art and I have been wanting to improve my skills. I feel that college has always been the best option for me and I'd love to take my creative mind into the work field. </p>

<p>Among my hobbies, I have two cats, a black one, <strong>Jovie</strong>, and an orange one, <strong>Sammy</strong>. Jovie is more of "my" cat in the sense that I'm always the person in my family that she hangs around the most. She has a cat tree in my room and can usually be found either there or in my bed. Sammy usually resides in our basement because, like a typical orange cat, he's a bit crazy. We still love him though.
